## OOP

- One of the several programming paradigms
    - functional
    - logic
    - event-driven
    - .. many more

- A way to manage and think about the state (data of the application)
- Models interactions within and between states
- Based on concepts of "Objects"
- "Objects" have data and code associated with them


### Four Main Ideas of OOP

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### Javascript Specifics

- JS is NOT a traditional "OOP Language"
- "Classes" are built on top of Prototypes
- We have an actual "Object" type in JS
- We can simulate most/all of core OOP concepts
